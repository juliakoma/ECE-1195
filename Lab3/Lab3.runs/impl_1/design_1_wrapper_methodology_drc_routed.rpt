2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/counter_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/prod_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/prod_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/shifter_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/Multi_Unit_0/U0/control_unit_inst/shifter_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
